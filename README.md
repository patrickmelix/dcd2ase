*DEPRECEATED*
Reading DCD files is now implemented in ASE. This is therefore not needed anymore. Updated the script to use the new ASE
features.

# dcd2ase
Convert DCD Trajectories to ASE Atoms. If called as a script convert xyz and dcd input into one ext-xyz trajectory file.

Requirements:
* ~~pwtools: https://github.com/elcorto/pwtools (do not use pip install, this will give you a different package!!)~~
* ASE: https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/
* Also using: os, argparse
